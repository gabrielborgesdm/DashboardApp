# Simple Financial Control #
Simple Financial Control is an application that helps you to have control of your budget: incomes and expenses.

I divided it into back-end and front-end. The first one is a Rest API in Node that uses JWT, Bycript, and other technologies that increases security. The second one is a responsive React application which interacts with the API.
