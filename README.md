# Simple Financial Control #
Simple Financial Control is an application that helps you to have control of your incomes and expenses.

I divided the application in back-end and front-end. The first part is an API Rest Server, the second is a responsive web application developed with React, and the third one is a mobile app created with React Native. To know more about features and installation instructions, have a look at the project available on my portfolio.
